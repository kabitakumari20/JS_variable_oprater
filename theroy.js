//why we need let const

// const and let are blocked scoped and if you try to use variable 
// declared with let or const before the declaration you'll get a ReferenceError.
// Finally the difference between let and const is that once 
// you've assigned a value to const , you can't reassign it,
// but with let , you can



// deffrence between let and const

// var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while let and const are
//  block scoped. var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; 
//  let variables can be updated but not re-declared; const variables can neither 
//  be updated nor re-declared. They are all hoisted to the top of their scope

// var is which type scope
// var is a funcation scope


// let is which type scope
// let is a block scope scope

//const is which type scope
// const is a block scope scope
